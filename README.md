Question is if I correctly assigned the indicators numbers in Q matrix to its names ( see code and pdf ). 


In Q Matrix, instead of dividing it by T, I just divided MegaEUR by 1000 000 so that we get just EUR .


But for some reason as I think , the difference between the OLD and NEW Q Matrices is 100.000 magnitude, not sure why.
